After creating many iterations of my portfolio site, opting for complex designs, I wanted to create something minimalistic: bringing the most important information forward while still remaining beautiful. Thus, the current iteration features a simple color palette, and a user interface emphasizing the most important information, rather than the design. Moreover, I wanted to create a blog for sharing some of my thoughts in the near future, and thought this'd be the perfect opportunity to do so.

The blog does need some work, currently, it's essentially a protype, however, I plan on enhancing it in soon (i.e., migrating blogs to a database, adding a modal for creating blogs, commenting, login etc.)

### Built With
Opted for React: this seemed like a no-brainer - React also worked perfectly for creating the blogs.
